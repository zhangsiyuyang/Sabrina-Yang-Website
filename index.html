        CHASS Peer Educator</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Ever since I was a child, I have been immersed in the fashion industry environment. I still remember the times when I would wear shower towels in different ways to have mock fashion shows with my elementary friends. I am grateful that my grandpa is so kind and knowledgeable that he shared with me his experience with working at Louis Vuitton when he was younger. Visiting my mom’s office when she was a fashion magazine editor, made me realize that one day I want to be in this industry as well. This passion followed me when I moved to America from China. I decided to major in Business Administration with a concentration in Data Analytics, hoping one day I can work for a clothing company, being in charge of product management, and other administrative works. <br><br>

        While fashion is my main career direction, I am also enthusiastic about environmental advocacy. In 2017, I started a student run non-profit organization along with 2 other members. In the surge of 2 years, our organization grew in ways we never imagined before. We had the chance to meet with a representative from Vanuatu, and organized a computer donation to their country. Our crew also shot footage there, and we will have a Documentary premiere in April of 2020. As the treasurer of Planet Save, I was so excited to promote our organization and oversee fundraisers to let more people know about Planet Save. I collected over $1000 dollars from individuals, and a total of 4000 dollars of grants and sponsorships from those who support what we do. I learned how to make a balance sheet, income statement, and profit and loss sheets all from the experience of working at Planet Save.<br><br>
       
        But that’s not all I do. At University of California- Riverside, I am a programming committee member of Future Business Leaders of America. As an event planner, I genuinely enjoy seeing every member having a great time at events that I planned. So far I was involved in planning our Creativity Workshop, Painting Repose, and Ten Ren’s Tea Time Fundraiser. Throughout these events, I learned how to work with team members, and other professional working manners. <br><br>

        I am glad I have the opportunity to work on what I love at different organizations, combining the best of both worlds. During my free time, I like to sketch and paint, and my professional experiences allow me to grow my ability to audit finances on Excel sheets, plan events, and learn how to work as a team. I am proficient in both Madarin, and Cantonese. I believe my experiences make me more dependable as an employee. To sum it all up, I love fashion and I love business, looking for more opportunities to work for a clothing company.
